Problem Statement: Write a Program to implement Orphan process.
Overview: In the Orphan process when i run fork() function first it will
run parent id after that it will run again fork() and run child id and then it
will go sleep then our code will be terminated for some time but at the
back-end it will run and after 5sec our code run again and print child id
and parent id but in this orphan process the parent id will be different in
both the cases.
â€¢ C-Program:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
int main()
{
printf("orphan process..\n\n");
int x=fork();
if(x==0)
{
printf("Child \n");
sleep(5);
printf("Child process id: %d\n",getpid());
printf("Child process show (Parent id): %d\n", getppid());
}
else
{
printf("parent \n");
printf("Parent process id: %d\n",getpid());
}
}
